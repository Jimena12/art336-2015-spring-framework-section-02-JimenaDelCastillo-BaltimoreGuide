                    <p><b>Camden Yards History</b> When Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened on April 6, 1992, a new era of Major League Baseball began. The park was brand new, but still old-fashioned. State-of-the-art, yet quaint. At less than a day old, it was already a classic.
Oriole Park at Camden Yards inspired a generation of ballpark construction. No longer would communities across America build multipurpose stadiums devoid of character, surrounded by vast parking lots. Ballparks would now be created to nestle neatly into existing and historic neighborhoods and play key roles in the revitalization of urban America.
Oriole Park at Camden Yards captured the nation's attention from day one and in the 20 seasons that followed, has served as the standard by which all new ballparks are measured. Citizens of Baltimore and all of Maryland, as well as Orioles fans throughout Birdland, should take great pride in the fact that our team makes its home in the ballpark that forever changed baseball.

</p>

                    <p>Baltimore’s Oreole <i>Baltimore</i> America's early colonists noticed a bird whose male bore the black and orange colors of Lord Baltimore, Maryland's founder. It was called a Baltimore oriole until the 1960s, when it was observed to interbreed with a bird called Bullock's oriole. The American Ornithologists' Union declared both would be considered a single species: Northern oriole. But later studies showed that, while the two birds sometimes interbreed, the offspring rarely pass along their genes. In 1994, the Baltimore oriole recovered its status as a species.</p>

                    <p>With an extensive history in both Washington, DC, and Baltimore, today the National Aquarium carries on the legacy of the nation’s first aquarium. As a nonprofit organization whose mission is to inspire conservation of the world’s aquatic treasures, the National Aquarium champions environmental initiatives by engaging with visitors, volunteers, students and citizens from around the world to actively participate in the preservation of our natural resources and living systems.
Originally established in 1873 in Wood’s Hole, Massachusetts, National Aquarium, Washington, DC, was considered the nation’s first public aquarium. In 1878, the National Aquarium moved to the site of the Washington Monument, and in 1932, the Aquarium was incorporated into the lower level of the Commerce Building. Federal funds were eliminated from the operating budget for the National Aquarium, Washington, DC, in 1982. Threatened with closing, the National Aquarium Society was formed to keep the Aquarium open.
Meanwhile, during the 1970s, then-Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer conceived and championed the idea of an aquarium as a vital component in the redevelopment of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. In 1976, Baltimore City residents voted on a bond referendum in favor of building the National Aquarium, Baltimore. Groundbreaking for the facility took place on August 8, 1978. In 1979, the new aquarium was recognized by the United States Congress, which granted the facility "national" status. The National Aquarium, Baltimore, opened to the public on August 8, 1981.
In 2003, the National Aquarium Society Board of Directors signed an alliance agreement with the Board of Directors of the National Aquarium, Baltimore, enabling the two aquariums to work together to strengthen the animal collection and educational impact of the National Aquarium.
On September 30, 2013, National Aquarium, Washington, DC, closed its doors to the public, due to necessary renovations in the Department of Commerce. For more information on the closing and a future National Aquarium presence in Washington, DC, visit aqua.org/dc.
Today, the National Aquarium, Baltimore, features a living collection of more than 17,000 fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and marine mammals living in award-winning habitats. In summer 2013, the Aquarium opened Blacktip Reef, a breathtaking exhibit replicating an Indo-Pacific reef and featuring more than 700 animals, including a school of blacktip reef sharks.

                    <p>Maryland is famous for its crabs, and Phillips Seafood is Baltimore's premiere restaurant for award-winning crab cakes!  After more than 30 years in its original Inner Harbor location, Phillips Seafood has moved across the Baltimore harbor.
Beneath the lights of the massive 17-foot tall Phillips letters, now part of the iconic Baltimore skyline, you’ll find a casual, polished restaurant with a revitalized feel.  We serve an extensive menu of classic seafood dishes along with plenty of dining choices for non-seafood lovers.  Enjoy the music from the famous piano that has been rolled across the harbor, with live music nightly in our lounge.  The open kitchen is a model of clean efficiency and provides a birds-eye view of the chefs in action.
No matter when you visit, there's always something going on in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.  Popular attractions such as the National Aquarium are just steps away from our doors, and we're conveniently located within easy walking distance of countless downtown hotels.  We hope to see you soon!
